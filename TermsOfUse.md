# Terms of Use

#### Last Modified July 12, 2023

The below terms and conditions govern your access to and use of LeagueOS.gg and/or LeagueOS-branded applications, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the same (collectively, and with any replacements thereof, the “Website”). Any services and functionalities offered to users through the Website may collectively be referred to as “Services” herein.

Within this policy, “you” or “User” means a user of the Website, and “we”, “us”, “our” or “LeagueOS” refers to LeagusOS, Inc., a Delaware corporation. There may be various categories of Users, and a reference to a User by another term (e.g., a League Owner or Sponsor), or providing specific terms applicable to certain categories of Users, does not affect or change the general obligations of all Users as set forth in this policy.

By using the Website, or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound by and to abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, found at [https://www.leagueos.gg/privacy](https://www.leagueos.gg/privacy), incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy at any time, you must not continue to access or use the Website.

PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION PROVISION SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH LEAGUEOS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.

USERS UNDER 13: If you are under the age of 13 and located within the United States, you may not use the Website unless your parent or other legal guardian consents to your use of the Website. Outside of the United States, the Website is offered and available only to users who are at least 18 years old, or the legal age of majority under applicable law, and you agree not to use or access the Website if you are not of such legal age of majority.

1. **General.** We may revise and update this policy from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, or if required by law, when we provide notice to you of such changes. Such changes apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter, and your continued use of the Website means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are also subject to any additional posted policies and rules related to specific Services and features which may be presented to you at the time of accessing and/or using such Services or features. All such policies are incorporated by reference into this policy and made part of this policy.

2. **Provision of Services.** We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Website in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Website, or the entire Website, to some or all Users. We will send any notices and messages to you via the email address you provide to us when creating an account on the Website, and you agree to keep your contact information up to date.

3. **Your Account.** Users are required to make an account to use certain Services (each, an “Account”). All Users must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when creating an Account, and all Users agree to promptly update Account information in the event it changes. We may require that you log in through a third-party API to verify your identity. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you choose; you should not provide your Account information to any other person and your Account may be used only by you personally. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security, and you agree to logout of your Account at the end of each session. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time by logging into your Account and terminating your Account.

4. **Leagues and Participation in Leagues.** The Website provides an opportunity for Users to create leagues and to participate in leagues (collectively, “Leagues”). A User who creates and/or acts as an administrators for a League may be referred to as a “League Owner”. 

   1. All Users acknowledge that LeagueOS provides only a platform to allow its Users and third parties to host and/or take part in certain leagues, tournaments, or other game play activities, and in certain cases, to access or connect to a third-party service to stream participation game play or other participation in a League. Unless provided otherwise via the Website from time to time, LeagueOS is not affiliated with any video game, computer game, other game, the owners of any such games, or the providers of third-party streaming platforms, which may be used in connection with a League. If you are a League Owner or participant in a League, you represent and warrant that you have the right to publicly perform gameplay of such game and solicit others to do the same, including under any terms and conditions set forth to you when purchasing or obtaining access to the game.

   2. If you are a League Owner, you may choose to make your League private or public. If you choose a private League, only those persons who are invited to your League may join it. If you choose a public League, participation in that league will be open to any User of the Website, although we may allow you to set certain limits on the number of players, or levels of experience of participants, who are able to join the League.

   3. As a League Owner, you may choose to communicate additional terms to participants of the League, provided that (a) such terms do not conflict with the terms set forth herein, or create the impression that Users may take any action which is prohibited hereunder; and (b) such terms do not purport to exclude or remove any User from the League on the basis of any factor which could be considered discriminatory under relevant law. All Users acknowledge that to the extent a specific League communicates additional terms to you, those terms are set forth only by League Owners, and not by LeagueOS, and that in the event of any conflict between such terms and this policy, this policy shall control.

   4. League Owners may request or require that Users provide certain information as part of joining a League via LeagueOS. League Owners shall not sell such data, or any other data of Users that is controlled by LeagueOS, and should not use any such data for any purpose other than use of the Services.

   5. Unless provided otherwise via the Website from time to time, LeagueOS is not affiliated with any League Owner, except to the extent that the League Owner is also a User of the Website. To the extent a League Owner offers or promises certain prizes or incentives for participation in a League, the responsibility for fulfilling such offers and promises is solely the responsibility of the League Owner, and not LeagueOS. You hereby waive any claims against LeagueOS related to, and hold LeagueOS harmless from, any claims, losses, or other liability related to your participation in any League or other tournament or game play offered via the Website.

5. **Sponsorship.** The Services may also include the ability for League Owners to identify and connect with possible sponsors for a League (each, a “Sponsor”). For clarity, Sponsors are also Users of the Website. Sponsorship may include certain payments made to participants in a League in exchange for using a Sponsor’s products or services, or broadcasting or using Sponsor’s trademarks, logos, and name. Sponsorships are subject to the below terms:

   1. All Users acknowledge and agree that any sponsorship is offered solely by a third party and not by LeagueOS. LeagueOS is providing only the opportunity for connection between Leagues and possible Sponsors. League Owners are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness and terms of a sponsorship with a third party. To the extent that LeagueOS makes a suggestion or performs any matchmaking between a Sponsor and a League in any manner, such suggestions may be automated and are based only on information provided to LeagueOS regarding each party’s ideal partners, and should not be construed to be reviewed by or endorsed by LeagueOS in any manner.

   2. Once a League Owner and a Sponsor have determined the terms of their relationship, those terms should be entered into the LeagueOS system in the manner provided to you.

      1. You are required to provide notice to participants that a Sponsor has been engaged for a League, and LeagueOS will provide this notice on your behalf when you report to LeagueOS that you have engaged or plan to engage a Sponsor. Users may terminate their participation in a League if they do not agree with the terms provided related to the sponsorship.

      2. To the extent that the terms are based on metrics that LeaugeOS has the ability to track (for example, a minimum number of participants in the league, a minimum number of hours of play time or streaming time, etc.), LeagueOS may assist Sponsors in enforcing their arrangements with Leagues. LeagueOS may review the achievement of such metrics at the request of a Sponsor or may perform audits of some or all Sponsor agreements from time to time. Sponsors will be given the opportunity to terminate their agreement with a League if such metrics are not achieved. However, Sponsors will not be refunded any amounts already paid at the time of termination. Users acknowledge that LeagueOS’s decision to review or audit such arrangements is offered to help improve the services LeagueOS offers to both Leagues and Sponsors, and you agree that LeagueOS shall have no liability, and you waive any claims against LeagueOS that may result from or relate to the termination of any arrangement or agreement between a Sponsor and a League. 

   3. All Users agree to comply with the United States Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines regarding advertising, as well as any other advertising guidelines required under applicable law (“Advertising Standards”). For example, if a Sponsor provides a User or a League with payment or products in exchange for discussing, using, promoting, or mentioning a product or service via the Website in any manner, you must disclose such relationship and do so in accordance with relevant Advertising Standards. You, as the User, are solely responsible for any endorsements or testimonials you make regarding any product or service of a third party or Sponsor through the Website, and you agree to hold LeagueOS harmless for your violations of any Advertising Standards. Sponsors are prohibited from requiring any action by other Users which does not comply with Advertising Standards. 

   4. A League Owner may choose a preset option, as defined by LeagueOS, related to the access a Sponsor will be given to User data and allowable uses of that data. When a Sponsor agrees to sponsor such league, the Sponsor is agreeing to comply with the terms of that present option selected by the League Owner. In any case, no Sponsor is entitled to sell any data obtained from LeagueOS; any data that Sponsor obtains may be used for Sponsor’s internal purposes only.

6. **Public Information.** LeagueOS may recommend a third-party site to use in connection with live streaming events for a League that you are in, including but not limited to Twitch.tv. To the extent that you participate in any live streaming as part of participation in a League (whether you are livestreaming or you are featured as a player in someone else’s livestream), you acknowledge that you are subject to the terms of use and privacy terms of that third party. You further acknowledge that such third party may allow the ability for the public (who may not have accounts with LeagueOS or such third party) to view such live stream. Our default is that any live streams will be archived for 30 days and such streams may be replayed by others within that period. LeagueOS may retain recordings of any and all live streams, including for the purpose of reviewing such live streams for any violation of content standards or other provisions of this policy. 

7. **Content Standards, Use Restrictions.**

   2. Further, all Users agree to comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, and regulations in your use of the Website. Users shall not:

      1. Use the Services in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of LeagueOS’s websites or the Services or interferes with any other party's use of the Services, or in any other manner that is unlawful or prohibited by this policy.

LeagueOS reserves the right to remove User Content for any reason or no reason, with or without prior notice.

   4. LeagueOS does not endorse any User Content. LeagueOS is not responsible for, and you waive any claims against and hold LeagueOS harmless from, any liability for any User Content or for any loss or damage resulting therefrom to any person or entity, regardless of the claim or cause of action under which such loss or damage is claimed to arise, including but not limited to defamation, libel, slander, or obscenity laws and regulations.

   5. Note that if you violate any of the above content guidelines, you will likely be in violation of any sponsorship agreement related to any Leagues you are in, which could cause your League to lose its sponsorship agreement and any associated prizes or funds.

   6. When it is either clear from the Service being provided, or otherwise communicated to you (whether in our policies or upon accessing a certain Service), that your User Content will be publicly available or viewable (such as via a live stream), you are advised to refrain from uploading or transmitting any User Content that you desire to remain confidential, including intellectual property you have created and sensitive personal information. You acknowledge that LeagueOS cannot and will not police or resolve allegations of misuse of your property or confidential information when you choose to publicly provide that information. 

8. **Use of Third-Party Rights; Reporting Infringement.**

   1. If you are uploading User Content in any way to the Website, you agree to refrain from sharing content, including music, videos, and other works which you do not have right or authority to share. Please be aware that purchasing music through via MP3 or another format generally does not give you the right to broadcast or share that music with others.

   2. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law.

If you save a payment method to your Account, you hereby consent to LeagueOS charging that payment method when you agree to pay for certain Services without any further consent from you. We may use a third-party payment processor for payments. Such payment processor may have separate terms of use or service, and such third-party payment processor’s terms of use are as set forth by such third-party on their platforms.

   2. Any fees we may charge are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state). If we are obliged to collect or pay taxes, the taxes will be invoiced to you. If you believe a charge is incorrect, you must contact us in writing within 30 days of the charge date containing the amount in question to be eligible to receive an adjustment or credit.

13. **Disclaimer.** LEAGUEOS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICES, THE WEBSITE, THE SUITABILITY OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OR RECEIVED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICES OR WEBSITE, OR ANY SERVICES OR RESULTS RECEIVED THROUGH THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. LEAGUEOS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. LEAGUEOS MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE PLATFORM, LEAGUEOS IP, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL: MEET CUSTOMER’S OR ANY OTHER PERSON’S REQUIREMENTS; OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR OTHER SERVICES, BE SECURE, ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR FREE. LEAGUEOS FURTHER MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE CONTENTS OR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

14. **Limitation of Liability.** UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LEAGUEOS, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PARENTS, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SHAREHOLDERS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, DATA DELETION, DATA CORRUPTION, OR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, FAILURE TO STORE ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY THE SERVICES, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PLATFORM, OR THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER ARISING. SHOULD LEAGUEOS BE FOUND LIABLE DESPITE THE ABOVE, EACH USER AGREES THAT IN ANY CASE, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT LEAGUEOS MAY BE LIABLE FOR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100.00 OR TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO LEAGUEOS DURING THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

15. **Indemnification.** You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless LeagueOS, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners, licensors, and advertisers from all liabilities, claims, demands, and expenses, including attorney's fees, made by any third party that arise from your use of the Services, your Submissions, your connection to the Services, your violation of this Agreement, your violation of the LeagueOS Privacy Policy, or your violation of any rights of another. LeagueOS reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you shall cooperate with LeagueOS in asserting any available defenses.

16. **Governing Law and Arbitration.** YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
   
    1. USERS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS WILL BE ADJUDICATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND ALL USERS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR OTHER JOINT ACTION WITH AS AGAINST LEAGUEOS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES PROVIDED.

    2. All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Minnesota or any other jurisdiction).

    3. You and LeagueOS will engage in good faith negotiation to resolve any dispute, claim, or question, and use respective best efforts to settle the same, as a condition precedent to either party initiating any court action, lawsuit, mediation, or arbitration. If no resolution is reached, either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, as provided herein. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including access to and use of the Services, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under the applicable commercial arbitration rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

    4. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, non-appealable, and binding on the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    5. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

17. **Limitation on Time to File Claims.** ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

18. **Entire Agreement.** This Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy (and any terms referenced within such policies as being incorporated into the policies) contain the entire agreement between LeagueOS and you as a User of the Services. No other communications, whether direct or indirect, between you and LeagueOS will, or are intended to, alter or supersede any provision of this Terms of Use or Privacy Policy. 

19. **Waiver and Severability.** No waiver by LeagueOS of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of LeagueOS to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

20. **Comments and Concerns.** We welcome our Users to report any suspected violation of this Terms of User or Privacy Policy, including allegedly incorrect information posted by Users, by reaching out to us using the following contact email: legal@leagueos.gg. We will investigate any such report and may act as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion.
